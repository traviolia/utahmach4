/* 
 * The master files are preprocessed and then run through an awk script that
 * decides what to do.
 * 
 * The config statement must be first. Any preprocessor magic
 * affecting the configuration should be done before it.
 * 
 * 
 * config CONFIG
 * specifies the configuration CONFIG is a list of options separated by
 * spaces, plus (+) signs, or minus (-) signs.  Spaces and pluses add to
 * the set, minuses remove.  Options are processed from left to right.
 * 
 * file FILENAME
 * specifies that the given file name is always part of the program.
 * 
 * fileif OPTION FILENAME
 * The file is included if the option is part of the configuration.
 * 
 * options OPTION DEFINE VALUE FILE
 * The preprocessor symbol DEFINE is defined to be VALUE if OPTION is part of
 * the configuration or zero otherwise. The definition is made in the file
 * FILE.
 * 
 * makeoptions OPTION MAKEFILESTUFF
 * MAKEFILESTUFF is read by make when the program is being built iff OPTION
 * is part of the configuration.
