# Need to search /usr/include to pick up <hpdev/XXX> files.
# We were searching a hardwired path to a mach tree, but this should work
# just as well.

# Revision 1.2  1995/03/10  17:18:21  mike
# Changes to make it compile/link in the new build environment

# Revision 1.1.1.1  1995/03/02  21:49:27  mike
# Initial Lites release from hut.fi

#

# This file contains parisc-specific make rules for all of Lites.
#
# SRCDIR must be set to the directory of the parisc source tree.
# SECTIONS must be set to any optional sections to activate.
# (The current directory is assumed to be the object directory.)


# Get rid.

# XXX yow!  Needed to pick up files in <hpdev/xxx> which I don't want to
# install in /usr/mach4/include/mach/machine.

# Required compiler/assembler flags.
# Note that we don't have to bother with HOST_anything
# for assembly language sources:
# the host probably can't execute parisc assembly language anyway.
TARGET_ASFLAGS	+= -DASSEMBLER


# The generic source tree doesn't know about assembly language,
# so we work it out here.
# The SRCDIRS variable isn't complete yet
# (it doesn't have the generic directories in it),
# but that's no problem because we know there's no assembly language
# in the generic directories anyway.
